   "bio":[
     "Academy Award and seven-time Emmy-nominated, and Peabody and Emmy-winning filmmaker Joe Berlinger has been a leading voice in nonfiction film and television for two decades. His films include the landmark documentaries BROTHER’S KEEPER, the PARADISE LOST Trilogy, which helped lead to the release of the wrongfully convicted West Memphis Three, and METALLICA: SOME KIND OF MONSTER, a film that re-defined the rockumentary genre.",

     "A tour de force in the true crime space for almost 25 years, Berlinger’s most recent four-part true crime documentary series, &#8220;COLD BLOODED: THE CLUTTER FAMILY MURDERS,&#8221; reexamined the crime chronicled in Truman Capote’s landmark book and Oscar-nominated film. Additional credits include KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP, that tells the haunting story of a former motel manager sentenced to die for orchestrating a murder that he swears he had nothing to do with; the eight-part docuseries &#8220;GONE: THE FORGOTTEN WOMEN OF OHIO,&#8221; focusing on the deaths and disappearances of six young women in southern Ohio - a tragic saga shrouded in a mystery exploring the dark underbelly of a struggling Midwest region plagued by drug and sex trafficking, and a system that seems to have failed to protect these women; &#8220;JUDGEMENT DAY: PRISON OR PAROLE&#8221;, a deeply immersive investigative series that took viewers inside the process of the high stakes decisions made at parole hearings as they are unfolding with actual cases every day; &#8220;THE SYSTERM WITH JOE BERLINGER,&#8221; which explored controversial cases within the criminal justice system, raising riveting questions about innocence guilt and if justice inevitably served; as well as TONY ROBBINS: I AM NOT YOUR GURU, a vérité film that goes behind the scenes of the mega once-a-year seminar &#8220;Date With Destiny;&#8221;",

     "CRUDE, his film about oil pollution in the Amazon Rainforest won 22 human rights, environmental and film festival awards. Six of Berlinger's documentary features, including his Emmy-nominated 2012 Paul Simon documentary UNDER AFRICAN SKIES, have premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, earning three Grand Jury Prize nominations. He has also received multiple awards from the Directors Guild of America, the National Board of Review and the Independent Spirit Awards.",

     "Berlinger’s most recent film, INTENT TO DESTROY, pulls back the curtain on mass murder censorship in Hollywood due to U.S. government pressure to appease a strategic ally and explores the violent history of the Armenian Genocide and legacy of Turkish suppression and denial over the past century.",

     "Currently, his new feature film &#8220;EXTREMELY WICKED, SHOCKINGLY EVIL AND VILE&#8221; starring Zac Efron, Lilly Collins, John Malkovich and Jim Parsons is in post production for a late 2018 release."
