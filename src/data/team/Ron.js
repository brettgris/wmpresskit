   "bio":[
      "Ronald L. Kuby is a New York City-based criminal defense and civil rights lawyer practicing for over three decades. A graduate of Cornell Law School, Kuby began his career with legendary radical lawyer William M. Kunstler, with whom he interned in 1982. Joining the small firm operating out of Kunstler’s basement, the duo championed the most unpopular cases and the most despised clients. Kunstler and Kuby represented convicted Central Park Jogger &#8220;repist&#8221; Yusef Salaam on appeal and post -convection, though Kunstler died before he could see Salaam vindicated. They represented Islamist defendants in the first wave of anti-Muslim hysteria following the first World Trade Center bombing, conscientious objectors who refused to fight in the first Gulf War, numerous members of the armed wing of the Puerto Rico independence movement, Black Liberation Army, and other armed antiimperialists, squeegee men, squatters and striking workers. They fought death penalty cases in Texas and New York, and defended freedom of speech all the way to the Supreme Court in flag burning cases." ,

      "After Kunstler’s death in 1995, Kuby continued with his mentor’s work, winning a massive judgment against racist subway vigilante Bernhard Goetz, effectively bankrupting him. Kuby aggressively pursued police misconduct through federal civil rights litigation, while providing a high-quality criminal defense for the most marginalized members of society. Oddly enough, he also became New York’s foremost authority on the law of public nudity, representing dozens or artists, photographers, models and dissidents who used their skin to convey their message.",

      "Kuby’s experience with complex post-conviction cases led him to his first &#8220;wrong man&#8221; case in 2000, when he won the exoneration of two men who had been wrongfully convicted of murder and spent 13 years each behind bars. Since then Kuby has helped to exonerate numerous others who were actually innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted, often exposing police corruption and prosecutorial misconduct. In addition to the actually innocent, Kuby maintains a busy criminal defense practice for the actually guilty-of-something, working to help mitigate the harsh and unforgiving nature of the criminal justice system. Like his late and beloved mentor, Kuby has dedicated his life to racial and social justice.",

      "Kuby also maintained a well-paying career as a talk radio host between 1996 and 2009, then again from 2014 to 2017, as well as serving as a guest anchor on the now-defunct Court TV, and a brief stint at MSNBC. It was media work that freed him to take on most of his actual innocence work pro bono.",

      "Kuby achieved the apogee of cinematic fame in The Big Lewbowski, where the Dude, in the Malibu Police Station, demands Kunstler or Kuby as his lawyer."
