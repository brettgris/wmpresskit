	synopsis: [
		"Three cases are re-investigated, each over the course of two episodes, with the help of an esteemed and engaging group of experts: a renowned civil rights attorney, a former prosecutor, a retired NCIS investigator, and a member of Detroit's elite Homicide Task Force. Together, they are joined by local investigators who take us on a verit√© journey to hunt for new evidence, track down witnesses, interview often reluctant law enforcement, and spend time with the families of the incarcerated."
